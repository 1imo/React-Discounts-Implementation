# React-Discounts-Implementation
My take on an interview question

Question I am answering
Programming Exercise – Supermarket checkout

Written in a language of your choice, implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.
In a normal supermarket, items for sale are identified using Stock Keeping Units or ‘SKUs’. In this store, this supermarket uses individual letters of the alphabet to represent these SKUs. Our goods are priced individually, however, some items are multi-priced: buy n of them, and it’ll cost you y instead.
For example, item ‘A’ might cost £0.50 individually, but this week the special offer is: buy three ‘As’ and it’ll cost you £1.30.
Please find below this week’s special offers:

Item
Unit Price
Special Price

A
50
3 for 130
B
30
2 for 45
C
20
2 for 38
3 for 50
D
15
5 if purchased with ‘A’


Notes
This exercise will be used to gauge how you approach a software engineering problem – the processes you use, the quality of your code and the robustness of the solution.
Do use as many or as few technologies and processes as you normally would when developing this solution
Feel free to write tests, use version control and rely on IDE tools.
Don’t get hung up on the specifics of the implementation.
The problem is intentionally abstract, giving you the freedom to come up with your own unique solution.
This exercise should only last 1 hour 30 minutes.
